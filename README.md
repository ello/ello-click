# Ello Click - External link affiliation

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ello/ello-click.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ello/ello-click)

Within Ello external links in posts are rewriten to point to this service.

Each link can then be affiliated as appropriate. No previously affiliated links
are re-affiliated. Affiliation fees are taken from store revenues and do not
effect artist revenue. The end user is then redirected to the affiliated url.

### Quickstart

This is a vanilla Elixir Plug application, getting started is pretty easy:

* Install exenv/Elixir 1.3
* Clone this repo
* Run `mix deps.get`
* Run the test suite with `mix test`
